            <div class="Rbodyc01">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
                which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized
                networks based on blockchain technology a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of
                computers. <br> <b>Examples;</b> <br>
                <li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
                <li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>
                <li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
                <li>Zcash (ZEC)</li>

            <div class="Lbodyt02">HOW DID CRYPTO CURRENCY START</div>
            <div class="Lbodc02">In 1998, developer Wei Dai proposed an "anonymous, distributed electronic cash system" 
                called B-money. Dai suggested two different protocols, including one which required a broadcast channel that 
                was both synchronous and unjammable. Ultimately, B-money was never successful; indeed, it differed from 
                Bitcoin in many ways. Nonetheless, it was also an attempt at an anonymous, private, and secure electronic 
                cash system. <br> <br>
                <li>The first cryptocurrency was eCash, created by David Chaum's <br>company DigiCash in 1990.</li>
                <li>There were several attempts to create a viable and accepted <br>cryptocurrency before Bitcoin.</li>
                <li>eCash, B-money, Bit Gold, and Hashcash were very influential <br>in Bitcoin's creation.</li>

            <div class="Rbodyt03">WHY IS CRYPTO CURRENCY USED?</div>
            <div class="Rbodyc03">
                Digital currencies have utility similar to physical currencies. They can be used to purchase goods and pay for services. They can also find restricted use among certain online communities, such as gaming sites, gambling portals, or social networks.<br> <br>
                Digital currencies also enable instant transactions that can be seamlessly executed across borders. For instance, it is possible for a person located in the United States to make payments in digital currency to a counterparty residing in China, provided they are both connected to the same network.
